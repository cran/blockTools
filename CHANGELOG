- Modernize CITATION file 
- Integrate testthat tests
- Create extract_conditions() to extract treatment conditions from assignment object

Version 0.6-3 (2 December 2016):

- Update assg2xBalance() to handle when factor names are characters as well as numbers.
- Fix block() issue when reporting factor unit names
- Fix block() to handle data frames stored as tibbles
- NAMESPACE updates


Version 0.6-2 (8 January 2015):

- In block(), drop variables where variance is 0 overall and warn the user.
- In block(), eliminate removal of blocking variables with 0 variance within a group, since scaling matrix is not caculated for each group.
- In block(), fix instances where optgreed.c and naive.c returned errors for groups with only one unit.
- Bug fixes and documentation editing for seqblock() and block2seqblock().
- Updated Maintainer and Author affiliation.
- Update title capitalization and replace require() libraries with :: to conform to Writing R Extensions guidelines.


Version 0.6-1 (22 May 2014):

*** New ***
- Added function seqblock() for sequential experiments
- Added function invertRIconfInt() to create confidence intervals by inverting the randomization test
- Added function block2seqblock() to translate output from block() to input for seqblock(), for when experiment starts with many units, then adds new units sequentially after initial set of assignments.
- Added manual files for seqblock(), invertRIconfInt(), and block2seqblock()


Version 0.5-8 (8 April 2014):

- In assignment() and demo/block.R, remove dependence on library(gtools) by replacing odd() and even() with (… %% 2) == 1 and == 0, respectively.
- Move library(MASS) from Depends: to Imports:
- In block(), fix bug to correctly attach namesCol values to output object.  
- In assignment(), correctly attach namesCol values to output object and provide new length options.
- In block(), fix a bug in valid.var that incorrectly led to an error message.


Version 0.5-7 (30 July 2013):

- Remove .First.lib (zzz.R)
- In block(), reformat output from algorithm = "optimal".
- In block(), changed default optfactor to 10^7 so that vanilla blockings of x100 with groups run successfully.
- In block(), now print error when user provides invalid "algorithm" argument.
- Added option block(distance = "euclidean").
- Changed packages nbpMatching and xtable from "Depends" to "Suggests", to only invoke when needed.
- Added function createBlockIDs() to output vector of integers to uniquely identify blocks.
- Added function assg2xBalance() to ease balance calculations for assignment objects where n.tr = 2.
- Added unfactor() function (not exported) to assist createBlockIDs() and assg2xBalance().
- In block(), added argument namesCol, an optional vector of column names for the output of block().
- In block(), drop variables within groups where variance is 0 and warn.
- In block(), if a variable has IQR 0 and distance = "mvd" or distance = "mcd", then block() now returns a warning and proceeds using the nonresistant distance = "mahalanobis".
- Changed behavior of block() and assignment() to output any unblocked units and incomplete blocks.  For consistency with the motivation for the level.two argument, if level.two = TRUE, then unblocked units are listed, but unblocked subunits in units that have a subunit blocked are not listed.
- Simplified C files' structure
- In block(), added error message when valid.var is specified, but valid.range is not.
- Added CITATION file.


Version 0.5-6 (1 August 2012):

- Display bug fix in file block.R (wherein units with distance zero were blocked as desired, but reported as having distance NA).


Version 0.5-5 (11 June 2012):

- Memory allocation bug fixes in files mahaloptgreed.c and optgreed.c.


Version 0.5-4 (7 May 2012):

- In outTeX(), added arguments enabling user to specify output file name(s) and caption(s) directly, as lists of length(block.obj$blocks) or length(block.obj$assg), depending on whether block.obj is output from block() or assignment().  File names are reused as table reference labels, in the form "t:filename".   
- In outCSV(), added argument enabling user to specify output file name(s) directly, as list of length(block.obj$blocks) or length(block.obj$assg), depending on whether block.obj is output from block() or assignment(). 


Version 0.5-3 (4 March 2011):

- In block(), repaired valid.var and valid.range arguments for algorithms other than "optimal".  These worked in 0.4-1, not 0.5-1 or 0.5-2.
- In block(), added warning that valid.var and valid.range arguments are ignored for algorithm = "optimal".


Version 0.5-2 (16 November 2010):

- In block(), added warning for attempts to use algorithm = "optimal" with n.tr > 2.  (Optimal algorithm only implemented for n.tr = 2.  After warning, block() returns optimal blocks for n.tr = 2.)
- In block(), corrected class of display of blocks for algorithm = optimal.
- In block(), corrected display of blocks for n.tr > 3 (from 0.5-1).
- Updated CHANGELOG format.


Version 0.5-1 (5 October 2010):

- In block(), blocking now done in C for all algorithms except algorithm = "optimal".
- In block(), toggled to check.names = FALSE in data.frame() creation of output object.
- In block() manual page, added MCD and MVE citations and clarification of n.tr > 2 algorithms.


Version 0.4-1 (28 October 2009):

- In block(), added algorithm = "optimal" option.
- In block(), added optfactor argument.
- Updated manual reference and maintainer information.
- Made minor manual edits, such as adding appropriate \dQuote{}'s.


Version 0.3 (25 April 2009):

- In block(), added weight argument.
- Updated maintainer information.
- Added CHANGELOG.
