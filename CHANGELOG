Version 0.5-3 (4 March 2011):
- In block(), repaired valid.var and valid.range arguments for algorithms other than "optimal".  These worked in 0.4-1, not 0.5-1 or 0.5-2.
- In block(), added warning that valid.var and valid.range arguments are ignored for algorithm = "optimal".

Version 0.5-2 (16 November 2010):
- In block(), added warning for attempts to use algorithm = "optimal" with n.tr > 2.  (Optimal algorithm only implemented for n.tr = 2.  After warning, block() returns optimal blocks for n.tr = 2.)
- In block(), corrected class of display of blocks for algorithm = optimal.
- In block(), corrected display of blocks for n.tr > 3 (from 0.5-1).
- Updated CHANGELOG format.

Version 0.5-1 (5 October 2010):
- In block(), blocking now done in C for all algorithms except algorithm = "optimal".
- In block(), toggled to check.names = FALSE in data.frame() creation of output object.
- In block() manual page, added MCD and MVE citations and clarification of n.tr > 2 algorithms.

Version 0.4-1 (28 October 2009):
- In block(), added algorithm = "optimal" option.
- In block(), added optfactor argument.
- Updated manual reference and maintainer information.
- Made minor manual edits, such as adding appropriate \dQuote{}'s.

Version 0.3 (25 April 2009):
- In block(), added weight argument.
- Updated maintainer information.
- Added CHANGELOG.
